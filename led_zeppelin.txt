"Good Times Bad Times"

In the days of my youth, I was told what it means to be a man
And now I've reached that age, I've tried to do all those things the best I can
No matter how I try, I find my way into the same old jam

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home with a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Sixteen, I fell in love with a girl as sweet as could be
It only took a couple of days 'til she was rid of me
She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end
But when I whispered in her ear, I lost another friend, oh

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

Good times, bad times, you know I've had my share
When my woman left home for a brown eyed man
But I still don't seem to care

I know what it means to be alone
I sure do wish I was at home
I don't care what the neighbours say
I'm gonna love you each and every day
You can feel the beat within my heart
Realize, sweet babe, we ain't ever gonna part 


"Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You"

Babe, baby, baby, I'm gonna leave you

I ain't joking woman, I've got to ramble
Oh, yeah, baby, baby, I believing

I can hear it calling me back home

Babe, I'm gonna leave you
Oh, baby, you know, I've really got to leave you

Tongue wag so much when I send you the bill 


"Your Time Is Gonna Come"

Lying, cheating, hurting, that's all you seem to do

Made up my mind to break you this time
Won't be so fine, it's my turn to cry

It's fading away, can't feel you anymore
Don't care what you say cause I'm going away to stay
Going to make you pay for that great big hole in my heart
People talking all around
Watch out woman, no longer

You been bad to me woman
But it's coming back home to you

Your time is gonna come

"What Is And What Should Never Be"

And if I say to you tomorrow
"Take my hand, child, come with me
It's to a castle I will take you
Where what's to be, they say will be."

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high in the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

And if you say to me tomorrow
Oh what fun it all would be
Then what's to stop us, pretty baby
But what is and what should never be

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high
In the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

So if you wake up with the sunrise
And all your dreams are still as new
And happiness is what you need so bad
Girl, the answer lies with you

Catch the wind
See us spin
Sail away
Leave today
Way up high
In the sky

But the wind won't blow
You really shouldn't go
It only goes to show
That you will be mine
By taking our time

Oh the wind won't blow
And we really shouldn't go
And it only goes to show

Catch the wind
We're gonna see it spin
We're gonna sail
Leave today
Do do do, bop bop a do-oh. My my my my my my yeah

Everybody I know seems to know me well
But they're never going to know that I move like hell
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby. Oh Lord
Baby baby babe. Huh? Oh I love ya
Do no no no no no no. C'mon now
I want you now 


"The Lemon Song"

I should have quit you a long time ago
Oh, yeah, long time ago
I wouldn't be here, my children
Down on this killing floor

I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Oh, I should have listened, baby, to my second mind
Every time I go away and leave you, darling
You send me the blues way down the line

Baby, yeah
Give it to me, baby
My, my, my
Take it down a bit
Give it to me, baby
Keep me satisfied

Trying worry 'bout me, baby
But I'd never get you with myself
Keep on worrying, baby
Can't keep you satisfied
Huh, let me tell you, baby
You ain't nothing but a two-bit no good jive

I went to sleep last night
I worked as hard as I can
I bring home my money
You take my money
Give it to another man

I should have quit you, baby
Oh, such a long time ago, oh
I wouldn't be here with all my troubles
Down on this killing floor

Squeeze me baby, 'til the juice runs down my leg
Squeeze me baby, 'til the juice runs down my leg
The way you squeeze my lemon, ah
I'm gonna fall right out of bed
Bed, bed, bed, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh

I'm going to leave my children down on this killing floor


"Thank You"

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me

Kind woman, I give you my all
Kind woman, nothing more

Little drops of rain whisper of the pain
Tears of loves lost in the days gone by
My love is strong
With you there is no wrong
Together we shall go until we die, my, my, my
An inspiration is what you are to me
Inspiration – look, see

And so today, my world, it smiles
Your hand in mine, we walk the miles
And thanks to you it will be done
For you to me are the only one
Alright, yeah
Happiness, no more be sad
Happiness – I'm glad

If the sun refused to shine
I would still be loving you
When mountains crumble to the sea
There will still be you and me 


"Heartbreaker"

Hey fellas, have you heard the news?
You know that Annie's back in town
It won't take long, just watch and see
How the fellas lay their money down

Her style is new, but the face the same
As it was so long ago
But from her eyes, a different smile
Like that of one who knows

Well, it's been ten years or maybe more
Since I first set eyes on you
The best years of my life gone by
Here I am alone and blue

Some people cry and some people die
By the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rolling along
With the grace of the Lord above

People talking all around
About the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say
I know where their jive is at

One thing I do have on my mind
If you can clarify, please do
It's the way you call me by another guy's name
When I try to make love to you, yeah

I try to make love but it ain't no use
Give it to me, give it

Work so hard I couldn't unwind
Get some money saved
Abuse my love a thousand times
However hard I tried

Heartbreaker, your time has come
Can't take your evil way
Go away, heartbreaker
Heartbreaker!
Heartbreaker!
Heart! 


"Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman)"

With a purple umbrella and a fifty cent hat
Living, loving, she's just a woman
Missus cool rides out in her aged Cadillac
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

Alimony, alimony, paying your bills
Living, loving, she's just a woman
When your conscience hits, you knock it back with pills
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Come on, babe on the roundabout
Ride on the merry-go-round
We all know what your name is
So you better lay your money down

Telling tall tales of how it used to be
Living, loving, she's just a woman
With the butler and the maid and the servants three
Living, loving, she's just a woman

Nobody hears a single word you say
Living, loving, she's just a woman
But you keep on talking 'til your dying day
Living, loving, she's just a woman

"Ramble On"

The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though "our health" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
I gotta ramble on, I gotta find the queen of all my dreams

I tell you no lie

Mine's a tale that can't be told, my freedom I hold dear
How years ago in days of old, when magic filled the air
'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair
But Gollum, and the evil one crept up and slipped away with her
Her, her, yeah
Ah, there's nothing I can do now
I guess I'll keep on

Rambling, I'm gonna shake (Sing my song)
I gotta find my baby
I'm gonna ramble on, sing my song
Gonna work my way, going 'round the world
Baby, baby (Ramble on)
Do do do do do do do do, my baby
I can't stop this feeling in my heart
Every time I think about my baby I think "we gots to part"
Gotta keep on searching for my baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I gotta keep on searching for my baby
My, my, my, my, my, my, baby
I can't find my bluebird!
I listened to what my bluebird said, but I, I can't find my bluebird!
I keep rambling, baby


"Bring It On Home"

Baby, baby
I'm gonna bring it on home to you
I've got my ticket, I've got that load
Got up, gone higher, all aboard
I'll take my seat, right way back, ooh yeah
Watch this train roll down the track
I'm gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you
Watch out, watch out

Try to tell you baby
What you trying to do?
Trying to love me, baby
And love some other men too
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Went a little walk downtown
Messed and got back late
Found a note there waiting
It said, "Daddy, I just can't wait."
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it back home, bring it back home to me, baby

Tell you, pretty baby
You love to mess me around
I'm going to give you loving, baby
Going to move you out of town
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm going to give you loving, baby
I'm going to give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, oh, right

Bring it on home, bring it on home to you 


"Immigrant Song"

(2, 3, 4)

Ah! Ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah! Ah!
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords

On we sweep with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

So now you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing 


"Friends"

Bright light almost blinding
Black night still there shining
I can't stop, keep on climbing
Looking for what I knew
Had a friend, she once told me
You got love, you ain't lonely
Now she's gone and left me only
Looking for what I knew

Mm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just

Met a man on the roadside crying
Without a friend, there's no denying
You're incomplete, they'll be no finding
Looking for what you knew
So anytime somebody needs you
Don't let them down, although it grieves you
Some day you'll need someone like they do
Looking for what you knew

Mm, I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy just
I'm telling you now
The greatest thing you ever can do now
Is trade a smile with someone who's blue now
It's very easy, it's very easy
It's very easy, it's easy, easy, yeah 


"Celebration Day"

Her face is cracked from smiling
All the fears that she's been hiding
And it seems pretty soon everybody's gonna know
And her voice is sore from shouting
Cheering winners who are losing
And she worries if their days are few
And soon they'll have to go

My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna dance and sing in celebration
We are in the promised land

She hears them talk of new ways
To protect the home she lives in
Then she wonders what it's all about
When they break down the door
Her name is Brown or White or Black
You know her very well
You hear her cries of mercy
As the winners toll the bell

My, my, my, I'm so happy
I'm gonna join the band
We' gonna sing and dance in celebration
We are the promised land

There is a train that leaves the station
Heading for your destination
But the price you pay to nowhere
Has increased a dollar more. Yes, it has!
And if you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands and moan, oh, yeah

If you walk you're gonna get there
Though it takes a little longer
And when you see it in the distance
You will wring your hands


"Since I've Been Loving You"

Been working from seven
To eleven every night

"Out On The Tiles"

As I walk down the highway
All I do is sing a song
And a train that's passing my way
Helps the rhythm move along

There is no doubt about the words are clear
The voice is strong, it's oh so strong

I'm just a simple guy
I live from day to day
A ray of sunshine melts my frown
And blows my blues away

There's nothing more that I can say
But on a day like today I pass the time away
And walk a quiet mile with you

All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah

I'm so glad I'm living
Gonna tell the world I am
I got me a fine woman
And she says that I'm her man

One thing that I know for sure
Gonna give her all the loving
Like nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody can

Standing in the noonday sun
Trying to flag a ride
People go and people come
See my rider right by my side

It's a total disgrace, they set the pace
It must be a race and the best thing I can do is run

All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love
All I need from you is all your love
All you got to give to me is all your love

"Tangerine"

One, two
One, two, three, four
One, two

Measuring a summer's day
I only find it slips away to grey
The hours they bring me pain

Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between

Thinking how it used to be
Does she still remember times like these?
To think of us again
And I do

Tangerine, tangerine
Living reflection from a dream
I was her love, she was my queen
And now a thousand years in between 


"That's The Way"

I don't know how I'm going to tell you
I can't play with you no more
I don't know how I'm gonna do what mama told me
My friend, the boy next door
I can't believe what people saying
You're gonna let your hair hang down
I'm satisfied to sit here working all day long
You're in the darker side of town

And when I'm out I see you walking
Why don't your eyes see me
Could it be you've found another game to play
What did mama say to me?

That's the way
Oh, that's the way it ought to be
Yeah, yeah, mama say
That's the way it ought to stay

And yesterday I saw you standing by the river
And weren't those tears that filled your eyes
And all the fish that lay in dirty water dying
Had they got you hypnotized?
And yesterday I saw you kissing tiny flowers
But all that lives is born to die
And so I say to you that nothing really matters
And all you do is stand and cry

I don't know what to say about it
When all you ears have turned away
But now's the time to look and look again at what you see
Is that the way it ought to stay?

That's the way
That's the way it ought to be
Oh, don't you know now, mama said
That's the way it's going to stay, yeah 


"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp"

Ah, caught you smiling at me
That's the way it should be
Like a leaf is to a tree, so fine
Ah, all the good times we had
I sang love songs so glad
Always smiling, never sad, so fine

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

Well, if the sun shines so bright
Or on our way it's darkest night
The road we choose is always right, so fine
Ah, can your love be so strong
When so many loves go wrong
Will our love go on and on and on and on and on?

As we walk down the country lanes
I'll be singing a song, hear me calling your name
Hear the wind within the trees
Telling Mother Nature 'bout you and me

My, my
La la la
Come on now, it ain't too far
Tell your friends all around the world
Ain't no companion like a blue-eyed Merle
Come on now, well, let me tell you
What you're missing, messing 'round them brick walls

So of one thing I am sure
It's a friendship so pure
Angels singing all around my door, so fine
Yeah, ain't but one thing to do
Spend my natural life with you
You're the finest dog I knew, so fine

When you're old and your eyes are dim
There ain't no old Shep gonna happen again
We'll still go walking down country lanes
I'll sing the same old song, hear me call your name 


"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper"

Mm, a, mm, a, mm, a mm, a mm, a come on down

Ah, must I holler?
Must I shake 'em on down?

Well, I've done quit hollering, baby
I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Well, I ain't no monkey

No brown-skin woman gonna make no monkey out of me
Yeah, I ain't no monkey
Sure can't climb no tree

I been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down
Well, I've been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Listen, mama, put on your morning gown
Put in your nightshirt, mama
We going to shake them down
Must I holler?
Must I, must I, must I shake them on down?

Oh, I've been mistreated, babe, I believe I'll shake 'em on down

Gave my baby a twenty-dollar bill
If that don't get her, I'm sure my shot, shot, shotgun will
Yeah, I gave my baby a twenty-dollar bill
Well, if that don't get that woman, I'm sure my shotgun will
I'm gonna go shoot her now


"Key To The Highway / Trouble In Mind"

I got the key to the highway, yeah
Billed out and bound to go
I gotta keep walking this highway
Walking most too slow

I eat my breakfast in California
I eat my dinner in Caroline
Woo I'm gonna keep on
Keep on walking this highway, yeah
'Til I reach the end of the line

Walk on, yeah

Show the movie, yeah
Lordy mama keeps on shining, shining

"Black Dog"

Hey, hey, mama, said the way you move
Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you groove
Ah, ah, child, way you shake that thing
Gonna make you burn, gonna make you sting
Hey, hey, baby, when you walk that way
Watch your honey drip, I can't keep away

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

I gotta roll, can't stand still
Got a flaming heart, can't get my fill
Eyes that shine burning red
Dreams of you all through my head

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby
Tell me would you do me now
Hey, baby, oh, baby, pretty baby
Move me while you groove me now

Take too long 'fore I found out
What people mean by down and out
Spent my money, took my car
Started telling her friend she' gon' be a star
I don't know, but I've been told
A big-legged woman ain't got no soul

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh, oh, oh

All I ask for, all I pray
Steady rolling woman gonna come my way
Need a woman gonna hold my hand
Won't tell me no lies, make me a happy man

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby
Hey baby, pretty baby, oh baby

"Rock And Roll"

It's been a long time since I rock-and-rolled
It's been a long time since I did the Stroll
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Yes, it has

It's been a long time since The Book of Love
I can't count the tears of a life with no love
Carry me back, carry me back
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
Whoa, whoa, oh

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time

Oh! Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight
Making vows that just can't work right
Oh yeah, open your arms, opens your arms
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in!
Yeah!

It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's been a long time, been a long time
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time


"The Battle Of Evermore"

The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone

Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all

Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might
Of the darkest of them all

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon, waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no

Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red

Oh war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
That mortals never know

Oh, well, the night is long, the beads of time pass slow
Tired eyes on the sunrise, waiting for the eastern glow

The pain of war cannot exceed the woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The Ringwraiths ride in black, ride on

Sing as you raise your bow
(Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold

Oh dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold to bring the balance back
Bring it back

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes

Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back

Oh now oh now oh now oh, oh now oh now oh now
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
Oh now oh now oh now oh, oh now oh now oh now
Bring it bring it bring it bring it
Bring it bring it bring it bring it
Bring it bring it bring it bring it 


"Stairway To Heaven"

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it's whispered that soon if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forests will echo with laughter

Oh-oh-oh-oh-whoa

If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Oh, whoa

Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

And she's buying a stairway to Heaven 


"Misty Mountain Hop"

Walking in the park just the other day, baby
What do you, what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sitting on the grass with flowers in their hair said
Hey, boy, do you wanna score?
And you know how it is?
I really don't know what time it was
Whoa, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay a while

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
Really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me
And asked us said please, hey, would we care
To all get in line, get in line
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun
Oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh

Why don't you take a good look at yourself
And describe what you see?
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rusting
Ah! Not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming?
Oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind, ooh (No, no, no!)

If you go down in the streets
Today, baby you better
You better open your eyes
Folk down there really don't care
Really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm going to do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly, ooh

I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really don't know 


"Four Sticks"

Oh, baby, it's crying time
Oh, baby, I got to fly
Got to try to find a way
Got to try to get away
'Cause you know I gotta get away from you, babe

Oh, baby, the river's red
Ah, baby, in my head
There's a funny feeling going on
I don't think I can hold out long

And when the owls cry in the night
Oh, baby, baby, when the pines begin to cry
Baby, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how would you feel?

Craze, baby, the rainbow's end
Mm, baby, it's just a den for those who hide
Who hide their love to depths of life
And ruin dreams that we all knew so, babe

And when the owls cry in the night
And baby, when the pines begin to cry
Oh, baby, baby, how do you feel?
If the rivers run dry, baby, how do you feel?
Ah, ah
Baby, how do you feel?

Ooh yeah, brave I endure
Ooh yeah, strong shields and lore
They can't hold the wrath of those who walk
And the boots of those who march
Baby, through the roads of time so long ago

Ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah 


"Going To California"

Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
The sea was red and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
As the children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings
La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Trying to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems


"When The Levee Breaks"

If it keeps on raining, levee's going to break
If it keeps on raining, the levee's going to break
When the levee breaks, we'll have no place to stay

Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan, oh
Mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home
Oh well, oh well, oh well
Ooh

Oh, don't it make you feel bad
When you're trying to find your way home
You don't know which way to go
If you're going down south, they got no work to do
If you're going north to Chicago
Ah, ah, ah, hey

Crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
No, crying won't help you, praying won't do you no good
When the levee breaks, mama, you got to move, ooh

All last night I sat on the levee and moaned
All last night, sat on the levee and moaned
Thinking about my baby and my happy home
Oh-ho

Going
I'm going to Chicago
Going to Chicago
Sorry, but I can't take you, ah
Going down, going down now
Going down, I'm going down now
Going down, going down
Going down, going down
Oh
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going down now
Going down, going, dow-dow-dow-dow-down now
Ooh, ooh 


"The Song Remains The Same"

I had a dream, oh yeah
Crazy dream, oh ho
Anything I wanted to know
Any place I needed to go
Hear my song, yeah
People, won't you listen now?
Sing along, oh
You don't know what you're missing now
Any little song that you know
Everything that's small has to grow
And it's gonna grow now, push, push, yeah

Na-na-na-na-na
California sunlight
Sweet Calcutta rain
Honolulu Starbright
The song remains the same, ooh yeah

All you gotta do now, all you gotta do now
Ooh, sing out Hare Hare
Ooh, Dance the Hoochie Koo
City lights are oh so bright
As we go sliding, sliding
Sliding, sliding, sliding, sliding
Through 


"The Rain Song"

It is the springtime of my loving
The second season I am to know
You are the sunlight in my growing
So little warmth I've felt before
It isn't hard to feel me glowing
I watched the fire that grew so low, ooh, oh

It is the summer of my smiles
Flee from me, keepers of the gloom
Speak to me only with your eyes
It is to you I give this tune
Ain't so hard to recognize, oh
These things are clear to all from time to time, ooh
Oh, oh

Ah, talk, talk, talk, talk
Hey!
I've felt the coldness of my winter
I never thought it would ever go
I cursed the gloom that set upon us, upon us, upon us
But I know that I love you so, oh, oh
But I know that I love you so

These are the seasons of emotion
And like the winds they rise and fall
This is the wonder of devotion
I see the torch we all must hold
This is the mystery of the quotient quotient
Ah, upon us all, upon us all a little rain must fall
Just a little rain, oh yeah
Uh, ooh, yeah yeah yeah 


"Over The Hills And Far Away"

Hey, lady, you got the love I need
Maybe more than enough
Oh, darling, darling, darling, walk a while with me
Oh, you've got so much, so much, so much

Many have I loved, and many times been bitten
Many times I've gazed along the open road
Many times I've lied and many times I've listened
Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold

Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing
Guessing 'bout a thing you really ought to know, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Really ought to know (oh, oh, oh)
I really ought to know
Oh, you know I should, you know I should
You know I should've known 


"The Crunge"

I wanna tell you about my good thing
I ain't disclosing no names, but
He sure is a good friend, and
I ain't gonna tell you where he comes from, boy
If I tell you, you won't come again, hey
I ain't gonna tell you nothing, but I do will, but I know, yeah!
Now let me tell you about my girl
I open up a newspaper and what do I see?

Ah, ah
See my girl, ah, looking at me

Ooh, and when she walks, she walks
Let me tell you, when she talks, she talks
And when she looks me in my eye
She's my baby, Lord, I wanna make her mine, baby
Ooh, tell me, baby, what you want me to do!
And you want me to love you, love some other men?
Ooh, ain't gonna call me Mr. Pitiful, no!
I don't need no respect from nobody, no

Ah yeah, no, no
Ah

I ain't gonna tell you nothing, I ain't gonna tell you no more, no!
She's my baby, let me tell you that I love her so and, and!
She is the woman I really wanna love and let me tell you more
Ooh! She's my baby let me tell you, she lives next door
She's the one a woman the one a woman that I know
I ain't going, I ain't going, I ain't going to tell
I ain't going to tell you one thing
That you really ought to know, boy!

She's my lover, baby, and I love her so, and
She's the one that really makes me whirl and twirl, and
She's the kind of lover that makes me feel the whole world, and
She's the one who really makes me jump and shout, oh!
She's the kind of girl, I know what it's all about!
Take it on
Take it, take it, take it

Ah, excuse me
Oh, will you excuse me?
I'm just trying to find the bridge!
Has anybody seen the bridge?
Please!
(Have you seen the bridge?)
I ain't seen the bridge!
(Where's that confounded bridge?) 


"Dancing Days"

Dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
I got my flower, I got my power
I got a woman who knows

I said it's alright, you know it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?

Crazy ways are evident
By the way you wearing your clothes
Sipping booze is precedent
As the evening starts to glow

You know it's alright, I said it's alright
You know it's all in my heart
You'll be my only, my one and only
Is that the way it should start?
Dig

You told your mama I'd get you home
But you didn't say that I got no car
I saw a lion, he was standing alone
With a tadpole in a jar

You know it's alright
I said it's alright
I guess it's all in my heart, heart, heart, heart
You'll be my only
My one and only
Is that the way it should start?

So dancing days are here again
As the summer evenings grow
You are my flower, you are my power
You are my woman who knows

I said it's alright

"No Quarter"

Close the door, put out the light
You know they won't be home tonight
The snow falls hard and don't you know?
The winds of Thor are blowing cold
They're wearing steel that's bright and true
They carry news that must get through

They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They hold no quarter

Walking side by side with death
The devil mocks their every step, ooh
The snow drives back the foot that's slow
The dogs of doom are howling more
They carry news that must get through
To build a dream for me and you, oh

They choose the path where no-one goes
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter
They hold no quarter
They ask no quarter

Oh!
The pain, the pain without quarter, oh yeah!
They ask no quarter (without quarter, quarter, quarter)
They give no quarter (giving me, giving me no)
Oh (I hear the dogs of doom are howling more!) 


"The Ocean"

"We've done four already but now we're steady
And then they went: One, two, three, four"

Singing in the sunshine, laughing in the rain
Hitting on the moonshine, rocking in the grain
Got no time to pack my bags, my foots outside the door
I got a date, I can't be late, for the high hopes hailla ball
Oh ho
Oh yeah

Singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar (ooh)
Play for free, play for me and play a whole lot more, more! (ooh)
Singing about good things and the sun that lights the day (ooh)
I used to sing on the mountains, has the ocean lost its way?

I don't know
Oh-oh yeah
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na nana na na na na na na na na na na na na

Sitting round singing songs until the night turns into day (ooh)
Used to sing on the mountains, but the mountains washed away
(Ooh)
Now I'm singing all my songs to the girl who won my heart
She is only three years old and it's a real fine way to start

Oh yeah
It sure is fine
I blow my mind
When the tears are going down
Yeah, yeah

Oh, so good! 


"Custard Pie"

Ooh
Drop down, baby, let your daddy see
Drop down, my lady, just dream of me
Well, my mama, allow me to fool around all night long

Ain't no stranger, done been this way before

"The Rover"

I've been to London, seen seven wonders
I know to trip is just to fall
I used to rock it, sometimes I'd roll it
I always knew what it was for

There can be no denying
That the wind'll shake 'em down
And the flat world's flying
There's a new plague on the land

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands

Traversed the planet, when heaven sent me
I saw the kings who rule them all
Still by the firelight and purple moonlight
I hear the rested rivers call

And the wind is crying
From a love that won't grow cold
My lover, she is lying
On the dark side of the globe

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You got me rocking when I ought to be a-rolling
Darling, tell me, darling, which way to go
You keep me rocking, baby, then you keep me stalling
Won't you tell me, darling, which way to go, that's right

Oh how I wonder, oh how I worry
And I would dearly like to know
Of all this wonder, of earthly plunder
Will it leave us anything to show?

And our time is flying
See the candle burning low
Is the new world rising
From the shambles of the old?

If we could just join hands
If we could just join hands
If we could just, if we could just, if we could just
If we could just, if we could just join hands
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
That's all it takes, that's all it takes
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh yeah
Ah, ah, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, that's right 


"In My Time Of Dying"

In my time of dying
I want nobody to mourn
All I want for you to do
Is take my body home

Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Jesus got to make up
You know

Somebody, somebody

At the gates of heaven

Ah, oh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn
Let me blow your horn
Oh, I never did no harm
Did no harm

Somebody some good, yes, oh
Oh, did somebody some good, yeah
I must have did somebody some good, yeah
Oh, I believe I did
I see the smiling faces
I know I must have left some traces, oh

And I see them in the streets
And I see them in the field
And I hear them shouting under my feet
And I know it's got to be real
Oh Lord, deliver me
All the wrong I've done
Oh, you can deliver me, Lord
I only wanted to have some fun
Oh, hear the angels marching, hear them marching
Hear them marching, hear them marching, the marching

(Coughing)
Cough
That's gonna be the one isn't it?
Come have a listen then
Oh yes, thank you 


"Houses Of The Holy"

Let me take you to the movie
Can I take you to the show?
Let me be yours ever truly
Can I make your garden grow?

From the houses of the holy
We can watch the white doves go
From the door comes Satan's daughter
And it only goes to show
And you know

There's an angel on my shoulder
In my hand a sword of gold
Let me wander in your garden
And the seeds of love I'll sow
You know

So the world is spinning faster
Are you dizzy when you stall?
Let the music be your master
Will you heed the master's call?

Satan and man

Said there ain't no use in crying
'Cause it will only, only drive you mad
Does it hurt to hear them lying?
Was this the only world you had? Oh, oh

So let me take you, take you to the movie
Can I take you, baby, to the show?
Why don't you let me be yours ever truly?
Can I make your garden grow?
You know that's right

"Kashmir"

Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face
With stars to fill my dreams
I am a traveler of both time and space
To be where I have been
Sit with elders of the gentle race
This world has seldom seen
Talk of days for which they sit and wait
All will be revealed

Talk and song from tongues of lilting grace
Whose sounds caress my ear
But not a word I heard could I relate
The story was quite clear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh, baby, I been flying
No yeah, mama, there ain't no denying
Oh, ooh, yeah I've been flying
Mama, mama, ain't no denying, no denying

Oh, all I see turns to brown
As the sun burns the ground
And my eyes fill with sand
As I scan this wasted land
Trying to find, trying to find, where I've been

Oh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace
Like thoughts inside a dream
Here is the path that led me to that place
Yellow desert stream
My Shangri-La beneath the summer moon
I will return again
Sure as the dust that floats high in June
When moving through Kashmir

Oh, father of the four winds, fill my sails
Across the sea of years
With no provision but an open face
Along the straits of fear
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Ooh

Oh, when I'm on, when I'm on my way, yeah
When I see, when I see the way, you stay-yeah
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, when I'm down
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, but I'm down, so down
Ooh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there
Oh come on, oh, let me take you there... let me take you there
Ooh, yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah-yeah, let me take you there... let me take you there 


"In The Light"

And if you feel that you can't go on
And your will's sinking low
Just believe, and you can't go wrong
In the light, you will find the road
You will find the road

Hey, ooh, did you ever believe that I could leave you
Standing out in the cold?
Yeah, baby, I know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through
To the very depths of my soul, yeah
Oh-ho, baby, I just want to show you what a clear view
It is from every bend in the road
Now listen to me
Oh, whoa-whoa, as I was
And really would be for you, too, honey
As you would for me, oh, I would share your load
Let me share your load
Ooh, let me share, share your load

And if you feel that you can't go on
In the light, you will find the road
Hey, oh ho, the the winds of change may blow around you
But that will always be so
Whoa whoa, when love is pain it can devour you, but you are never alone
I will share your load, I will share your load

"Down By The Seaside"

Down by the seaside
See the boats go sailing
Can the people hear
Oh, what the little fish are saying?

Oh ooh
The people turned away, oh
The people turned away

Down in the city streets
See all the folk go racing, racing
No time left, oh no
To pass the time of day

Hey, hey, yeah
The people turned away
The people turned away
So far away, so far away

See how they run, see how they run
See how they run, see how they run
Do you still do the twist?
Do you find you remember things that well?
I wanna tell you
Some go twisting every day
Though sometimes it's awful hard to tell
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh, oh

Out in the country
Hear the people singing
Singing about their growing
Knowing where they're going
Yeah, yeah

Oh, oh, the people turned away, yeah
Oh, the people turned away

Sing loud for the sunshine
Pray hard for the rain
And show your love for Lady Nature
And she will come back again
Yeah, yes, she will

Oh, the people turned away
The people turned away 


"Ten Years Gone"

Then, as it was, then again it will be
And though the course may change sometimes
Rivers always reach the sea
Flying skies of fortune, each a separate way
On the wings of maybe, downing birds of prey
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to go
But as the eagle leaves the nest, got so far to go

Changes fill my time, baby, that's alright with me
In the midst I think of you, and how it used to be

Did you ever really need somebody
And really need 'em bad?
Did you ever really want somebody
The best love you ever had?
Do you ever remember me, baby?
Did it feel so good?
Cause it was just the first time
And you knew you would

Through the eyes and I sparkle, senses growing keen
Taste your love along the way, see your feathers preen
Kind of makes me feel sometimes, didn't have to grow
We are eagles of one nest, the nest is in our soul

Vixen in my dreams, with great surprise to me
Never thought I'd see your face the way it used to be
Oh darling, oh darling
Oh, oh darling, oh yeah, oh darling

I'm never going to leave you
I'm never going to leave
Holding on, ten years gone
Ten years gone, holding on, ten years gone
I'm never, I'm never
Ooh, yeah 


"Night Flight"

I received a message from my brother across the water
He sat laughing as he wrote, "The end's in sight"
So I said goodbye to all my friends
And packed my hopes inside a matchbox
Because I know it's time to fly

Oh, yeah, come on, meet me in the morning
Meet me in the middle of the night
Ah, yeah, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?
Ooh yeah, ah hah

I just jumped a train that never stops
So now somehow I know I'll never finish paying for my ride
Someone pushed a gun into my hand
Tell me I'm the type of man
To fight the fight without inquiring

Oh, yeah-ha come on, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, night, yeah?
Oh, well, the morning light is coming
Don't it make you wanna go and feel alright?

Oh, mama, well, I think it's time I'm leaving
Nothing here to make me stay
Whoa, mama, well, it must be time I'm going
They're knocking down them doors
They're trying to take me away
Please, Mr. Brakeman, won't you ring your bell
And ring it loud and clear?
Please, Mr. Fireman, won't you ring your bell?
Tell the people they got to fly away from here

Oh, I once saw a picture of a lady with a baby
Southern lady, had a very, very special smile
We are in the middle of a change in destination
When the train stops, all together we will smile

Oh, come on, come on now, meet me in the morning
Won't you meet me in the middle of the night, night, n-n-night?
Oh, oh yeah, everybody know the morning time is coming
Don't it make you wanna feel alright? Ah, ah, yeah
Make me feel alright
Fly now, baby
Get to fly, yeah
Fly now, baby
Ooh, hey hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh 


"The Wanton Song"

Silent woman in the night, you came
Took my seed from my shaking frame
Same old fire, another flame
And the wheel rolls on

Silent woman through the flames, you come
From the deep behind the sun
Seems my nightmares, my loving gun
Left me barely holding on, oh

With blazing eyes you see my trembling hand
When we know the time has come
Lose my senses, lose command
Feel your healing rivers run

Is it every time I fall
That I think this is the one?
Ooh, in the darkness can you hear me call?
Another day has just begun
Another day, yeah

Silent woman, my face is changed
Some know in ways to come
Feel my fire needs a brand new flame
And the wheel rolls on, rolls on
Rolls on, rolls on, babe, ooh 


"Boogie With Stu"

Been in town, my baby, we just got to rock on
Yeah, darling, we just got to go home
I don't want no tutti-frutti, no lollipop
Come on, baby, just rock, rock, rock

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, honey
We've been shaking all night
Oh, darling, we just got to roll right
Aah, ooh, my head, rock on, rock on

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe, hey babe

Come on baby, just rock, rock, yeah 


"Black Country Woman"

"Shall we roll it, Jimmy?"
("We're rolling on, what, one?")
("No, one again?")
("Got to get this airplane off.")
("Naw, leave it, yeah.")

Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me that you love me so
You didn't have to love me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to make me a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer in my face
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
That's alright, it's awful dog-gone clear

Hey, hey, baby, why you treat me mean?
Oh, oh, baby, why you treat me mean?
You didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, why'd you treat me mean?
You didn't have say you'd always be by my side
You didn't have to tell me you'd be my blushing bride
Hey, hey, mama, why you treat me mean?
But that's alright, I know your sisters, too

You didn't have to tell me that you love me so
You didn't have to leave me, mama, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
You didn't have to leave me like a total disgrace
You didn't have to leave me with that beer on my face
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
Oh, but that's alright, I'd be the same way, too

Now now now, you didn't have to crucify me like you did
You didn't have to tell me I was just your kid
Hey, hey, mama, what's the matter here?
You didn't have to tell me you would be my own
You didn't have to tell me, baby, let me go
Hey, hey, mama, what is wrong with you?
That's alright, I know your sister, too

What's the matter with you, mama? 


"Sick Again"

From the window of your rented limousine
I caught your pretty blue eyes
One day soon you're gonna reach sixteen
Painted lady in the city of lies

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, babe
I must be the one you need, yeah

Clutching pages from your teenage dream
In the lobby of the Hotel Paradise
Through the circus of the L.A. queens
How fast you learn the downhill slide

Oh, how you like my face?
Still don't know your name
You know I'm the one you want, babe, ooh yes
I must be the one you need, yeah

Oh, you got me feeling
Just a bit, just a bit

Lips like cherries and the brow of a queen
Come on, flash it, flash it in my eyes
Said you dug me since you were thirteen
Then you giggle as you heave and sigh

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
Baby, I gotta tell you, I'm the one you want
And everybody know I'm the one you need, yeah

Oh, give it to me, come on now
Come on now
Come on now

Hours, hours, and the moments in between
Oh, baby, I couldn't count the times
The fun of coming, oh, the pain in leaving
Baby, dry those silver eyes

Oh, do you know my name?
Do I look the same?
You know I'm the one you want, ooh yes
I'm the one you need, yeah

Ooh, that's right
Ooh, yeah, that's right
Ooh, that's right
That's right
That's right
Ooh yeah, that's right
That's right 


"Achilles' Last Stand"

It was an April morning
When they told us we should go
And as I turned to you, you smiled at me
How could we say no?
With all the fun to have
To live the dreams we always had
Oh, the songs to sing
When we at last return again

Sending off a glancing kiss
To those who claim they know
Below the streets that steam and hiss
The devil's in his hole
Oh to sail away
To sandy lands and other days
Oh to touch the dream
Hides inside and never seen, yeah

Into the sun, the south, the north
At last the birds have flown
Shackles of commitments fell
In pieces on the ground
Oh, to ride the wind
To tread the air above the din
Oh, to laugh aloud
Dancing as we fought the crowd, yeah

To seek the man whose pointing hand
The giant step unfolds
To guide us from the curving path
That turns our feet to stone
If one bell should ring
In celebration for a king
So fast the heart should beat
As proud the head, with heavy feet, yeah

Days went by when you and I
Bathed in eternal summer's glow
As far away and distant
Our mutual child did grow
Oh, the sweet refrain
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Oh Albion remains
Sleeping now to rise again

Wandering and wandering
What place to rest the search
The mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
For the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
From the earth, earth
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way
I know the way, know the way, know the way, know the way

Oh the mighty arms of Atlas
Hold the heavens from the earth
Ah, ah, ah 


"For Your Life"

You said I was the only
With my lemon in your hand
Exhibition is your habit
Emotion second hand
Had to pull away to save me
Maybe next time around
And she said, don't you want it?
Don't you want cocaine, cocaine, cocaine?
Hadn't planned to, could not stand to
Try it, fry it, na na na na yeah

Heard a cry for mercy
In the city of the damned
Oh, oh, babe, damned
Down in the pits you go no lower
The next stop's underground
Oh, hello underground
Wine and roses ain't quite over
Fate deals a losing hand
And I said, didn't mean to
Did not mean to f-fail
You didn't plan it, you over-ran it

You want do it, you want to
You want do it when you want to
You want do it, do it when you want to
When you blow it, babe
You got to blow it right
Oh baby, if you fake it, mama
Baby, fake with all your might
When you fake it, mama
Please fake it right for yourself, babe
When you fake it, baby
You're faking it for your life, for your life
For your life, for your life
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it when you wanna

Oh, I can have you, baby
But I don't know what to do, yeah
Sometime, baby, nothing I could do
On the balance of a crystal
Paying through the nose
And when they couldn't resist you
I thought you'd go with the flow
And now your stage is empty
Bring down the curtain, baby please
Fold up your show
Hadn't planned to
Could not stand to fry in it
Hadn't planned it
I over-ran it, frying
For your life, for your life 


"Royal Orleans"

One-time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite

A man I know went down to Louisiana
Had himself a bad, bad fight
And when the sun peeked through
John Cameron with Suzanna
He kissed the whiskers left and right
Whiskers

Now, now, now, fright subsides
Out at a hotel in the quarter
Our friends check in to pass the night
Now love gets hot, but fire preceded water
Poor whiskers set that room alight
Whiskers

Down on Bourbon street, you know it's right
You can see my friend
They run around all through the night
Most everywhere
Until the closet's bare
Run for the razor burn
Doing up my hair
New Orleans queens
Sure know how to schmooze it
Maybe for some that seems alright
When I step out
Strut down with my sugar
She'd best not talk like Barry White!

One-time love, take care how you use it
Try to make it last all night
And if you take your pick, be careful how you choose it
Sometimes it's hard to feel it bite
Feel it bite 


"Nobody's Fault But Mine"

Oh, nobody's fault but mine

Gonna change my ways tonight

Nobody's fault but mine

How to kick that gong to light
N-n-n-n-n-no, nobody's fault 


"Candy Store Rock"

Well
Oh baby baby, don't you want a man like me?
Oh baby baby, I'm just as sweet as anybody could be
Oh baby baby, I want to look to your eyes of blue
Oh baby baby, it's more than anybody else could do

Well
Oh baby baby, you know when I see you walking down the street
Oh baby baby, well you looking good enough to eat
Oh baby baby, I don't believe I've tasted this before
Oh baby baby, I want it now and every mouthful more of you

Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

Oh baby baby, you know that I wanted it more
Oh baby baby, I'm about to kiss goodbye to this store
Oh baby baby, it ain't the wrapping that sells the goods
Oh baby baby, I got a sweet tooth when my mouth is full of you

Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you
Talk about you, talk about you, talk about you

Ooh baby, oh
Baby it's alright, it's alright
Ooh

Well
Oh baby, baby, oh you sting like a bee
Oh baby, baby, I like your honey and it sure likes me
Oh baby, baby, I got my spoon inside your jar
Oh baby, baby, don't give me too much, don't make me starve

Oh baby, baby, sugar sister on a silver plate
Oh baby, baby, I need a mouthful and I just can't wait
Oh baby, baby, see the shaking in my hand
Oh baby, baby, don't mean to fumble but it tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand
Tastes so grand, tastes so grand

Alright 


"Hots On For Nowhere"

I was burned in the heat of the moment
Though it couldn't been the heat of the day
When I learned how my time had been wasted
Tear fell as I turned away

Now I've got friends who will give me their shoulder
When I should happen to fall
Time and his bride growing older
I've got friends who will give me fuck all

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

Corner of Bleecker and nowhere
In the land of not quite day
A shiver runs down my backbone
Face in the mirror turns grey

So looked 'round to hitch up the reindeer
Searching hard trying to brighten the day
I turned around to look for the snowman
To my surprise he'd melted away

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

As the moon and the stars call the order
Inside my tides dance the ebb and sway
The sun in my soul's sinking lower
While the hope in my hands turns to clay

I don't ask that my field's full of clover
I don't moan at opportunity's door
And if you ask my advice, take it slower
Then your story'd be your finest reward

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala, now do it

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Lost on the path to attainment
Search in the eyes of the wise
When I bled from the heart of the matter
I started bleeding without a disguise

Now everything's fine under heaven
Now and then you've got to take time to pause
When you're down on the ground, don't be messing around
Or you'll land in a boat without oars

Lalala, yeah
Lalala, my baby
Lalala, yeah
Lalala

Hey babe, hey babe, hey babe
I lost my way
Hey babe, hey babe
I really really do now
Hey babe, hey babe
I don't know where I'm going to find it
Hey babe, hey babe
Do you want to know
Do you really, really, want to help me, yeah?
Let me tell you now, babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so good that it must be right
Now my babe
Let me tell you
That it feels so, feels so, feels so good 


"Tea For One"

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
Oh, twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days, yeah?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

Sitting, looking at the clock
Oh, time moves so slow
I've been watching for the hands to move
Until I just can't look no more

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seems to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way

To sing a song for you
I recall you used to say
"Oh, baby, this one's for we two"
Which in the end is you anyway

How come twenty-four hours
Baby, sometimes seem to slip into days?
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way

There was a time that I stood tall
In the eyes of other men
But by my own choice I left you, woman
And now I can't get back again

How come twenty-four hours
Sometimes seem to slip into days?
Well, well, well a minute seems like a lifetime
Baby, when I feel this way
A minute seems like a lifetime
Oh, baby, when I feel this way
I feel this way


"In The Evening"

In the evening
When the day is done
I'm looking for a woman
But the girl don't come
So don't let her
Play you for a fool
She don't show no pity, baby
She don't make no rules

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I just got to have

So don't you let her
Oh, get under your skin
It's only bad luck and trouble
From the day that you begin
I hear you crying in the darkness
Don't ask nobody's help
Ain't no pockets full of mercy, baby
Because you can only blame yourself

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have

Oh it's simple
All the pain that you go through
You can turn away from fortune, fortune
Because that's all that's left to you
It's lonely at the bottom
Man, it's dizzy at the top
But if you're standing in the middle
Ain't no way you're gonna stop

Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
Oh, oh, I need your love
I got to have

Oh whatever
That your days may bring
No use hiding in a corner
Because that won't change a thing
If you're dancing in the doldrums
One day soon, it's got to stop, it's got to stop
When you're the master of the off-chance
When you don't expect a lot

Oh, oh, I need your love
I need your love
Oh, I need your love
I got to have, I got to have
I got to have your love
I got to have
Babe, I got to have your love
I got to have your love
Just got to 


"South Bound Saurez"

Baby, when you walk that sweet walk
Oh, you walk it good, yes, you walk it good
Baby, when you talk that sweet talk
It sounds so good, oh, so good

With a little bit of concentration
And a little bit of helping hands, yeah
And a little bit of raving madness
You know it makes me feel, baby
Both my feet are back on the ground

And when the rhythm takes me
It feels so good, oh, so good
Baby, if it keeps a-shaking
It will do you good, oh, so much good

With a little bit of stop-a-shaking, shaking
And a little bit of fly right down
Woo, just a little bit of sweet con-carne
It makes me feel, makes me feel
I got my feet on the ground

"Fool In The Rain"

Oh, baby

Well. There's a light in your eye that keeps shining
Like a star that can't wait for the night
I hate to think I've been blinded, baby
Why can't I see you tonight?
And the warmth of your smile starts a-burning
And the thrill of your touch gives me fright
And I'm shaking so much, really yearning
Why don't you show up, make it all right?
Yeah, it's all right

And if you promised you'd love so completely
And you said you would always be true
You swore that you never would leave me, baby
What ever happened to you?
And you thought it was only in movies
As you wish all your dreams would come true
It ain't the first time believe me, baby
I'm standing here feeling blue
Yeah, I'm blue

Now I will stand in the rain on the corner
I'll watch the people go shuffling downtown
Another ten minutes no longer
And then I'm turning around
The clock on the wall's moving slower
My heart it sinks to the ground
And the storm that I thought would blow over
Clouds the light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Oh, that I found

Hey, babe!
Ooh! Hands on the clock
Just don't seem to stop when I'm thinking it over
Ooh! Tired of the light
I just don't seem to find
Gotta get away, get away
Ooh! I see it in my dreams
But I just don't seem to be
I've got to get all, gotta get it all
Gotta get it all, I've got to get it all

Now my body is starting to quiver
And the palms of my hands getting wet
I've got no reason to doubt you, baby
It's all a terrible mess
And I'll run in the rain 'til I'm breathless
When I'm breathless I'll run 'til I drop, hey
The thoughts of a fool's kind of careless
I'm just a fool waiting on the wrong block, oh, yeah

Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I
Light of the love that I found
Light of the, hey, eh, light of the, hey, eh
Light of the love that I found
Light of the love that I found


"Hot Dog"

Oh, hot dog!

Well I just got into town today
To find my girl who's gone away
She took the Greyhound at the General Store
I searched myself I searched the town
When I finally did sit down
I find myself no wiser than before

She said we couldn't do no wrong
No other love could be so strong
She locked up my heart in her bottom drawer
Now she took my heart she took my keys
From in my old blue dungarees
And I'll never go to Texas anymore

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
I'm going to give her something like she never had before

I took her love at seventeen
A little late these days it seems
But they said heaven is well worth waiting for
I took her word I took it all
Beneath the sign that said "U-Haul"
She left angels hanging round for more

Now my baby's gone I don't know what to do
She took my love and walked right out the door
And if I ever find that girl I know one thing for sure
I'm going to give her something like she never had before

I thought I had it all sewn up
Our love, a plot, a pick-up truck
But folks said she was after something more
I never did quite understand
All that talk about rocking bands
But they just rolled my doll right out the door
Oh yeah, they just rolled my doll right out the door
Why, well, they just rolled my doll right out the door!


"Carouselambra"

Sisters of the way-side bide their time in quiet peace
Await their place within the ring of calm
Still stand to turn in seconds of release
Await the call they know may never come
In times of brightness, no intruder dared upon
To jeopardize the course, upset the run
And all was joy and hands were raised toward the sun
As love in the halls of plenty overrun

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Still in their bliss unchallenged mighty feast
Unending dances shadowed on the day
Within the wall, their daunting formless keep
Preserved their joy that kept their doubts at bay
Faceless legions stood in readiness to weep
Just turn a coin, bring order to the fray
And everything is soon no sooner thought than deed
But no one seemed to question in anyway

Ah, ah, ah, ah

How keen the storied hunter's eye prevails upon the land
To seek the unsuspecting and the weak
And powerless the fabled sat, too smug to lift a hand
Toward the foe that threatened from the deep
Who cares to dry the cheeks of those who saddened stand
Adrift upon a sea of futile speech?
And to fall to fate and make the 'status plan'
But no one there had heaven within their reach

I said yeah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Where was your word, where did you go?
Where was your helping, where was your bow, bow?

Dull is the armour, cold is the day
Hard was the journey, dark was the way, way

I heard the word, I couldn't stay, oh
I couldn't stand it another day, another day
Another day, another day

Touched by the timely coming
Roused from the keeper's sleep
Release the grip
Throw down the key

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the peace
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
They had to stay!

Held now within the knowing
Rest now within the beat
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed
Take of the fruit
But guard the seed 


"All My Love"

Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now

The cup is raised, the toast is made yet again
One voice is clear above the din
Proud Arianne one word, my will to sustain
For me, the cloth once more to spin

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love for you now
All of my love, all of my love, yes
All of my love to you, child

Yours is the cloth, mine is the hand that sews time
His is the force that lies within
Ours is the fire, all the warmth we can find
He is a feather in the wind

Oh, all of my love, all of my love
Oh, all of my love to you, now
All of my love, oh yes
All of my love to you
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love!
Sometimes, sometimes
Hey hey hey hey, ooh yeah
It's all all all
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love
All of my love to you, now
I get a little bit lonely
Just a little, just a little
Just a little bit lonely
Just a little bit lonely

"Poor Tom"

Here's a tale of Tom
Who worked the railroads long
His wife would cook his meal
As he would change the wheel

Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

Worked for thirty years
Sharing hopes and fears
Dreaming of the day
He could turn and say

Poor Tom, work is done
Been lazing out in the noonday sun
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

His wife was Annie Mae
With any man a game she would play
When Tom was out of town
She couldn't keep her dresses down

Poor Tom, seventh son
Always knew what was going on
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom

And so it was one day
People got to Annie Mae
Tom stood, a gun in his hand
And stopped her running around

Poor Tom, seventh son
Gotta die for what you have done
All those years of work are thrown away
To ease your mind is that all you can say?

But what about that grandson on your knee?
Them railroad songs, Tom would sing to me

Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Ain't nothing that you can hide from Tom
Hey
Keep a-trucking
Keep a-trucking
Hey

"Walter's Walk"

Oh, know I feel so strange looking out the door
Oh, trying hard to change and can't let it go
Oh, crying tears of pain, hurting more and more
Oh, every day's the same as you walk the floor

I'm walking the floor over you
I'm walking the floor

Every heart that breaks is a heart that's cold
Oh, to the hand that takes your dreamless soul
Oh, is it long to wait, is there much to pay?
Oh, sometimes it's hard waiting for the day

You know it's hard, I said it's hard
You know it's true
I said it's hard, you know it's hard
Still know it's true

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Every love that's changed spend it fully
In the eyes of the night was it hard to see?
If it never fails in spite of it all
So you hide in the tears, enter Walter's walk

You know it is true now
You know it is true now
Ooh, yeah

I am walking the floor over you
I am walking the floor

Every tear that falls is a smile that's lost
When you hear the call, can you count the cost?
As you stand alone do you wonder how?
Can you step aside, does it matter now?

Does it matter now?
Does it, now does it matter?
Does it matter?

Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah

Ooh, little baby, don't you know
Every tear that falls, does it matter now?
Does it matter now?
Oh yeah
Oh yes

Gonna pack my bags and move on my way

Sharing what I thought was mine
Gonna leave her where the guitars play

I'm gonna give you sweet loving cry
You're gonna boogie night and day

Bring it on home
Bring it on home
Bring it on home

Bring it on home
Home, home, home
Home, home, ooh yeah
You got it, you got it 


"Everybody Makes It Through"

Sunshine brings laughter
Rain clouds brings me down
I know forever after
I need the light, keep me ground
Whoa mama, I get so lonely
In the rain, feel so blue
I want you to remember, I'm your one and only, woman
Hey baby, hey baby, love you true!

Dream boy, on the river
Oh blue skies, on my mind
Ah the fields, seemed to glitter
I know, I know, will bring you down!

Ah baby, I've got some thinking
Whoa mama, strip my mind
Hey baby, I took a drinking
I know, I know come around!

In the light, in the light

Oh girl, stop your crying
Oh woman, dry your eyes
Whoa tomorrow, the sun will be shining
You won't remember all the tears you cried!

Hey baby, I think you wonder
Hey baby, tears of joy
Woman, tears of laughter
Sweet ma, sweet ma, I'm coming home!
'S all you got to do yeah!

With the light
Everybody needs the light

The light
'S all you got to do now!

Light, light, light, in the light!
Light, light, light, in the light!
